  version-file-extraction-pattern:
    description: |
      A RegEx to extract version from a version-source file. Should either match a full version, or return it as the
      first group. E.G:
      - '(?<=version=).+' - pattern match, e.g: 'version=5.0.3-SNAPSHOT' will extract matched string '5.0.3-SNAPSHOT'
      - '"version":\s*"([^"]+)"' - group match, will extract the first group. e.g: '"version": "1.0.0",' to '1.0.0'

      In case if there are groups in a pattern the first group will be extracted.

    description: |
      Format pattern for build metadata. EG: "build.{date[YYYY-MM-dd]}.{hash[0, 6]}". It is also possible not to
      customize variable outputs omitting square braces ([]) or even not to use any variables. Supported variables:
      - date[date_format]: a current date in UTC or time set in 'release-version-build-metadata-datetime' variable.
      Supports formationg included in square braces ([]). The date format will be applied by "Moment.js"
      library: https://momentjs.com/
      - hash[begin_index_inclusive, end_index_exclusive]: a commit hash, which trigerred this build. You can shorten
      the hash by specifying begin and end characters indexes included in square braces ([]), separated by a comma.
